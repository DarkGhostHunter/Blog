# Don't worry too much about macOS Ram

I usually try to tell users who are putting their eyes in a Mac to always max out the RAM part of their machines.

The purpose of focusing on RAM rather than a better CPU or storage size it's because it's the only thing that can affect performance and cannot be upgraded later. Well, you _can_ by simply buying a whole  another machine.

For sotfware development, you always should get the best CPU and RAM you can. From shoving Docker images and compiling binaries while looking the error on Chrome, there is always a need for both of them. RAM upgrades being the _cheapest_.

Alex Ziskind's new video decided to test three machines:

- Macbook Air M2 8GB / 256GB
- Macbook Pro M2 8GB / 512GB
- Macbook Pro M2 16GB / 256GB

Anyone would say that the 8GB machines would die before reaching the finish line, but macOS is very smart to manage RAM and avoid slowing the whole machine.

It's impressive how much software Alex throws at them, eating RAM and CPU while at it, and surviving. That includes heavy XCode and Docker development.

The conclusion is very easy to understand: the base model is a great start, and will survive some fiery battles, but the 16GB RAM machine will offer the most _snappier_ experience.

For the 512GB SSD model, it will have an edge if you need to process giant sets of sequential data due to the SSD speed (3GB/s), which is double than the base model (1.5GB/s).

Even that last part is _debatable_. Most processing (if not all) done by the CPU is done in the data that is in the RAM, which is miles faster than an SSD. While _filling_ the RAM may be a point for a faster, sizeable SSD, you won't be doing just one thing on your machine, and that's is a great argument to upgrade the RAM.

The final takeaway is that you shouldn't panic about your RAM. The memory management of macOS does magic, mostly helped by a lightspeed RAM access (100GB/s), data compression, cached data, and smart swap management.

Working on Docker and Jetbrains on 8GB should be fine, but of course 16GB would be better.
